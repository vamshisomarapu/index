<h1>PROJECT EXPERIENCES</h1>
<P>I participated in many science fair programmes,when I was in his school.
 In my 7th standard i made the working model of jcb with the help of syringe pumps.that project made me stood at first in my school.
  Later on I made a project on water conservation.Generally,many do not turn off the motor even the over head tank is filled.nNo one notice whether the tank is filled or not.In such cases water is wasted. In order to save that water,a sensor is arranged in the tank,which alarms the owners when the tank is full.
  I participated in INSPIRE program,which is conducted by the state government of telangana.INSPIRE program is a science fair,which is organised by government of telangana,In order to encourage the students to do experiments.
  Later on, I did a project on global warming.In that project I collected data on the pros and cons of co2 and tried to bring some awareness among people.Though it was common issue to do a project on global warming,but the way it was presented was really thought provoking.
  This time I constructed the working model of circulatory system.I clearly explained about the human circulatory system through my model. 
  I was invited to a workshop conducted by Dr.A.S.Rao awards council in the year 2016-17.I attended the workshop coducted which was conducted in vikas concept school,hyderabad.In the 7 days workshop,I was taught on many things in biology.Many experiments were made to perform in the workshop.I gave a seminar on human blood .In that seminar I discussed  about the blood groups,ways to detect blood groups,on blood tests,and on the blood transfer.      </P>
