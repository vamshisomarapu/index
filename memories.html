   <h1>MEMORIES</h1>
   <H2>Get Together</H2>
   July 8th is one of the memorable days in my life.because, on  that day we had a get together with my  intermediate and 10 th friends.
   On that day we went to a movie. Then to a park and had a great evening there.We played the craziest games.We talked about our school days nostalgia.
   On that particular day,everyone in our batch were free  to express their opinions on the rest of my batchmates.I got complaints and complements from my friends.From my bottom of my heart, I accepted their opinions and fellings on me.Really,It was the day I truly enjoyed the truth in my life.
   My friends are the best critics in my life.Later we had a great delicious dinner.I really feel to be blessed to have such caring friends in my life.
